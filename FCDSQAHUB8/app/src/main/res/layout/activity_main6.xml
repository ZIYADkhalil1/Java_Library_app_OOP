        android:text="The Faculty of Computing and Data Science has an unparalleled program in the Egyptian computer faculties, which is Data Science for Health Care
Data science for Healthcare
This program is available to students who have obtained an Egyptian General Secondary Certificate in Mathematics, Science or its equivalent, and international equivalent certificate students are accepted.
The field of data science in health institutions is witnessing an increasingly rapid development through successive developments in medical information systems, represented in electronic health records, and telehealth. This rapid progress has led to a growing need for cadres specialized in medical data science to develop and manage medical information systems to enhance and achieve goals, including shortening time, saving costs, which leads to the advancement of health care.
The health data science system contributes to providing comprehensive data and information about the patient at a high speed, high efficiency, in a convenient and easy way. If we add to this the application of the health data analysis system at the national level, its effectiveness and importance have a vital and strategic significance in terms of data sharing between different medical institutions, and not only within one institution.
From a statistical and epidemiological standpoint, the use of data in conjunction with other information processing techniques, can help determine prevalence, incidence and related data, to help manage health information, prioritize steps to be taken, and give an idea of ​​“things” that should be taken. The health data specialist anticipates it in anticipation of anything that might happen in the future."
